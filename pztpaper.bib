@article{Novoselov2005,
abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

@article{Li2009,
abstract = {Graphene has been attracting great interest because of its distinctive band structure and physical properties. Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite. We grew large-area graphene films of the order of centimeters on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition using methane. The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5\%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.},

@article{Zhang2005,
abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

@article{Geim2007,
abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

@article{Schedin2007,
abstract = {The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity. The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects, which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.},

The preparation technique has been developed from systematic studies about influences on the initial doping of freshly prepared graphene. We investigated the removal of adsorbates by vacuum treatment, annealing, and compensation doping using NH(3). Hysteretic behavior is observed in the electric field effect due to dipolar adsorbates like water and NH(3). Finally we demonstrate spatially selective doping of graphene using patterned PMMA. Four-terminal transport measurements of the p-n devices reveal edge channel mixing in the quantum hall regime. Quantized resistances of h/e(2), h/3e(2) and h/15e(2) can be observed as expected from theory.},

@article{Lafkioti2010,
abstract = {The intrinsic doping level of graphene prepared by mechanical exfoliation and standard lithography procedures on thermally oxidized silicon varies significantly and seems to depend strongly on processing details and the substrate morphology. Moreover, transport properties of such graphene devices suffer from hysteretic behavior under ambient conditions. The hysteresis presumably originates from dipolar adsorbates on the substrate or graphene surface. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to reliably obtain low intrinsic doping levels and to strongly suppress hysteretic behavior even in ambient air by depositing graphene on top of a thin, hydrophobic self-assembled layer of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The HMDS serves as a reproducible template that prevents the adsorption of dipolar substances. It may also screen the influence of substrate deficiencies.},

For graphene on a defective SiO2 substrate, we find a strongly different behavior: H2O adsorbates can shift the substrate’s impurity bands and change their hybridization with the graphene bands. In this way, H2O can lead to doping of graphene for much lower adsorbate concentrations than for free hanged graphene. The effect depends strongly on the microscopic substrate properties.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {Graphene field effect transistors commonly comprise graphene flakes lying on SiO(2) surfaces. The gate-voltage dependent conductance shows hysteresis depending on the gate sweeping rate/range. It is shown here that the transistors exhibit two different kinds of hysteresis in their electrical characteristics. Charge transfer causes a positive shift in the gate voltage of the minimum conductance, while capacitive gating can cause the negative shift of conductance with respect to gate voltage. The positive hysteretic phenomena decay with an increase of the number of layers in graphene flakes. Self-heating in a helium atmosphere significantly removes adsorbates and reduces positive hysteresis. We also observed negative hysteresis in graphene devices at low temperature. It is also found that an ice layer on/under graphene has a much stronger dipole moment than a water layer does. Mobile ions in the electrolyte gate and a polarity switch in the ferroelectric gate could also cause negative hysteresis in graphene transistors. These findings improved our understanding of the electrical response of graphene to its surroundings. The unique sensitivity to environment and related phenomena in graphene deserve further studies on nonvolatile memory, electrostatic detection, and chemically driven applications.},

The elastic deformations contribute only a very small resistance at the step. However, for graphene on SiC(0001) there is strong substrate-induced doping, and this is substantially reduced on the lower side of the step where graphene pulls away from the substrate.

abstract = {Bidirectional interdependency between graphene doping level and ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated in graphene/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 hybrid structures. The polarization of the PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 can be effectively switched with graphene electrodes and can in turn alter carrier type and density in the graphene. A complete reversal of the current-voltage hysteresis direction is observed in the graphene when external environmental factors are minimized, converting p-type graphene into n-type with an estimated carrier density change as large as \~{}10(13) cm(-2). Nonvolatility and reversibility are also demonstrated.},

@article{Xie2011,
abstract = {The transfer of electrons between a solid surface and adsorbed atomic or molecular species is fundamental in natural and synthetic processes, being at the heart of most catalytic reactions and many sensors. In special cases, metallic conduction can be induced at the surface of, for example, Si-terminated SiC1, or mixed-terminated ZnO2, in the presence of a hydrogen adlayer. Generally, only the surface atoms are significantly affected by adsorbates. However, remotely changing electronic states far from the adsorbed layer is possible if these states are electrostatically coupled to the surface. Here we show that the surface adsorption of common solvents such as acetone, ethanol, and water can induce a large change (factor of three) in the conductivity at the buried interface between SrTiO3 substrates and LaAlO3 thin films3-8. This phenomenon is observed only for polar solvents. Our result provides experimental evidence that adsorbates at the LaAlO3 surface induce accumulation of electrons at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, suggesting a general polarization-facilitated electronic transfer mechanism, which can be used for sensor applications.},

Using a combination of phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire polydomain thin-film models and epitaxial thin-film growth and characterization, the extrinsic or domain wall contribution to the low-field, reversible dielectric response is evaluated as a function of increasing domain wall density. Using epitaxial thin-film strain we have engineered a set of samples that possess a known quantity of 90° domain walls that act as a model system with which to probe the contribution from these ferroelastic domain walls. We observe a strong enhancement of the permittivity with increasing domain wall density that matches the predictions of the phenomenological models. Additionally, we report experimentally measured bounds to domain wall stiffness in such PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films as a function of domain wall density and frequency.},

@article{Meric2008,
abstract = {The novel electronic properties of graphene, including a linear energy dispersion relation and purely two-dimensional structure, have led to intense research into possible applications of this material in nanoscale devices. Here we report the first observation of saturating transistor characteristics in a graphene field-effect transistor. The saturation velocity depends on the charge-carrier concentration and we attribute this to scattering by interfacial phonons in the SiO2 layer supporting the graphene channels. Unusual features in the current-voltage characteristic are explained by a field-effect model and diffusive carrier transport in the presence of a singular point in the density of states. The electrostatic modulation of the channel through an efficiently coupled top gate yields transconductances as high as 150 microS microm-1 despite low on-off current ratios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of two-dimensional graphene devices for analogue and radio-frequency circuit applications without the need for bandgap engineering.},

Transport measurements in the quantum Hall regime reveal new plateaus of two-terminal conductance across the junction at 1 and 32 times the quantum of conductance, e(2)/h, consistent with recent theory.

In the Vtg-B plane, the fluctuations form crisscrossing lines that are parallel to those of the adjacent plateaus, with different temperature dependences for the conductance peaks and valleys. These fluctuations arise from Coulomb-induced charging of electron- or hole-doped localized states when the device bulk is delocalized, underscoring the importance of electronic interactions in graphene in the QH regime.},

The ability to direct-write arbitrary shapes and patterns of n-doped regions in graphene simply by scanning a laser source should facilitate the exploitation of p-n junctions for a variety of electronic and optoelectronic device applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a graphene p-n junction created by chemical doping. We find that chemical doping does not reduce mobility in contrast to top-gating. The preparation technique has been developed from systematic studies about influences on the initial doping of freshly prepared graphene. We investigated the removal of adsorbates by vacuum treatment, annealing, and compensation doping using NH(3). Hysteretic behavior is observed in the electric field effect due to dipolar adsorbates like water and NH(3). Finally we demonstrate spatially selective doping of graphene using patterned PMMA. Four-terminal transport measurements of the p-n devices reveal edge channel mixing in the quantum hall regime. Quantized resistances of h/e(2), h/3e(2) and h/15e(2) can be observed as expected from theory.},

@article{Baeumer2015,
abstract = {The next technological leap forward will be enabled by new materials and inventive means of manipulating them. Among the array of candidate materials, graphene has garnered much attention; however, due to the absence of a semiconducting gap, the realization of graphene-based devices often requires complex processing and design. Spatially controlled local potentials, for example, achieved through lithographically defined split-gate configurations, present a possible route to take advantage of this exciting two-dimensional material. Here we demonstrate carrier density modulation in graphene through coupling to an adjacent ferroelectric polarization to create spatially defined potential steps at 180°-domain walls rather than fabrication of local gate electrodes. Periodic arrays of p-i junctions are demonstrated in air (gate tunable to p-n junctions) and density functional theory reveals that the origin of the potential steps is a complex interplay between polarization, chemistry, and defect structures in the graphene/ferroelectric couple.},

@article{Chiu2010,
abstract = {We investigate electric transport in graphene on SiO2 in the high field limit and report on the formation of p-n junctions. Previously, doping of graphene has been achieved by using multiple electrostatic gates, or charge transfer from adsorbants. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to create p-n junctions by changing the local electrostatic potential in the vicinity of one of the contacts without the use of extra gates. The approach is based on the electronic modification not of the graphene but of the substrate and produces a well-behaved, sharp junction whose position and height can be controlled.},
