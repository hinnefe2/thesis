 abstract = {The electronic properties of graphene can be manipulated via mechanical deformations, which opens prospects for both studying the Dirac fermions in new regimes and for new device applications. Certain natural configurations of strain generate large nearly uniform pseudomagnetic fields, which have opposite signs in the two valleys, and give rise to flat spin- and valley-degenerate pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs). Here we consider the effect of the Coulomb interactions in strained graphene with a uniform pseudo- magnetic field. We show that the spin or valley degeneracies of the PLLs get lifted by the interactions, giving rise to topological insulator states. In particular, when a nonzero PLL is quarter or three-quarter filled, an anomalous quantum Hall state spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry emerges. At half- filled PLLs, a weak spin-orbital interaction stabilizes the time-reversal-symmetric quantum spin-Hall state. These many-body states are characterized by the quantized conductance and persist to a high temperature scale set by the Coulomb interactions, which we estimate to be a few hundreds Kelvin at moderate strain values. At fractional fillings, fractional quantum Hall states breaking valley symmetry emerge. These results suggest a new route to realizing robust topological states in mesoscopic graphene.},

 abstract = {The outstanding electrical, mechanical and chemical properties of graphene make it attractive for applications in flexible electronics. However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as approximately 125 ohms square(-1) with 97.4\% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as approximately 30 ohms square(-1) at approximately 90\% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.},

The polarization of the PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 can be effectively switched with graphene electrodes and can in turn alter carrier type and density in the graphene. A complete reversal of the current-voltage hysteresis direction is observed in the graphene when external environmental factors are minimized, converting p-type graphene into n-type with an estimated carrier density change as large as \~{}10(13) cm(-2). Nonvolatility and reversibility are also demonstrated.},

 abstract = {The next technological leap forward will be enabled by new materials and inventive means of manipulating them. Among the array of candidate materials, graphene has garnered much attention; however, due to the absence of a semiconducting gap, the realization of graphene-based devices often requires complex processing and design. Spatially controlled local potentials, for example, achieved through lithographically defined split-gate configurations, present a possible route to take advantage of this exciting two-dimensional material. Here we demonstrate carrier density modulation in graphene through coupling to an adjacent ferroelectric polarization to create spatially defined potential steps at 180Â°-domain walls rather than fabrication of local gate electrodes. Periodic arrays of p-i junctions are demonstrated in air (gate tunable to p-n junctions) and density functional theory reveals that the origin of the potential steps is a complex interplay between polarization, chemistry, and defect structures in the graphene/ferroelectric couple.},

 abstract = {The linear dispersion relation in graphene gives rise to a surprising prediction: the resistivity due to isotropic scatterers, such as white-noise disorder or phonons, is independent of carrier density, n. Here we show that electron-acoustic phonon scattering is indeed independent of n, and contributes only 30 Omega to graphene's room-temperature resistivity. At a technologically relevant carrier density of 1 x1012 cm-2, we infer a mean free path for electron-acoustic phonon scattering of >2 microm and an intrinsic mobility limit of 2 x 105 cm2 V-1 s-1. If realized, this mobility would exceed that of InSb, the inorganic semiconductor with the highest known mobility ( approximately 7.7 x 104 cm2 V-1 s-1; ref. 9) and that of semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( approximately 1 x 105 cm2 V-1 s-1; ref. 10). A strongly temperature-dependent resistivity contribution is observed above approximately 200 K (ref. 8); its magnitude, temperature dependence and carrier-density dependence are consistent with extrinsic scattering by surface phonons at the SiO2 substrate and limit the room-temperature mobility to approximately 4 x 104 cm2 V-1 s-1, indicating the importance of substrate choice for graphene devices.},

Previously, doping of graphene has been achieved by using multiple electrostatic gates, or charge transfer from adsorbants. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to create p-n junctions by changing the local electrostatic potential in the vicinity of one of the contacts without the use of extra gates. The approach is based on the electronic modification not of the graphene but of the substrate and produces a well-behaved, sharp junction whose position and height can be controlled.},

@article{Cordier2008,
 abstract = {Rubbers exhibit enormous extensibility up to several hundred per cent, compared with a few per cent for ordinary solids, and have the ability to recover their original shape and dimensions on release of stress. Rubber elasticity is a property of macromolecules that are either covalently cross-linked or connected in a network by physical associations such as small glassy or crystalline domains, ionic aggregates or multiple hydrogen bonds. Covalent cross-links or strong physical associations prevent flow and creep. Here we design and synthesize molecules that associate together to form both chains and cross-links via hydrogen bonds. The system shows recoverable extensibility up to several hundred per cent and little creep under load. In striking contrast to conventional cross-linked or thermoreversible rubbers made of macromolecules, these systems, when broken or cut, can be simply repaired by bringing together fractured surfaces to self-heal at room temperature. Repaired samples recuperate their enormous extensibility. The process of breaking and healing can be repeated many times. These materials can be easily processed, re-used and recycled. Their unique self-repairing properties, the simplicity of their synthesis, their availability from renewable resources and the low cost of raw ingredients (fatty acids and urea) bode well for future applications.},

 abstract = {We have used aqueous dispersions of silver nanowires to prepare thin, flexible, transparent, conducting films. The nanowires are of length and diameter close to 6.5 $\mu$m and 85 nm, respectively. At low thickness, the films consist of networks but appear to become bulk-like for mean film thicknesses above â¼160 nm. These films can be very transparent with optical transmittance reaching as high as 92\% for low thickness. The transmittance (550 nm) decreases with increasing thickness, consistent with an optical conductivity of 6472 S/m. The films are also very uniform; the transmittance varies spatially by typically <2\%. The sheet resistance decreases with increasing thickness, falling below 1 $\Omega$/â» for thicknesses above 300 nm. The DC conductivity increases from 2 Ã 10(5) S/m for very thin films before saturating at 5 Ã 10(6) S/m for thicker films. Similarly, the ratio of DC to optical conductivity increases with increasing thickness from 25 for the thinnest films, saturating at â¼500 for thicknesses above â¼160 nm. We believe this is the highest conductivity ratio ever observed for nanostructured films and is matched only by doped metal oxide films. These nanowire films are electromechanically very robust, with all but the thinnest films showing no change in sheet resistance when flexed over >1000 cycles. Such results make these films ideal as replacements for indium tin oxide as transparent electrodes. We have prepared films with optical transmittance and sheet resistance of 85\% and 13 $\Omega$/â», respectively. This is very close to that displayed by commercially available indium tin oxide.},

 abstract = {Graphene devices on standard SiO(2) substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO(2). These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

@article{Du2008,
 abstract = {The discovery of graphene raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 for carrier densities below 5 x 109 cm-2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.},

The produced films are mechanically robust, show high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram), and can thus be used directly as EC electrodes without the need for binders or current collectors, as is the case for conventional ECs. Devices made with these electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes while maintaining the high power density and excellent cycle stability of ECs. Moreover, these ECs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes under high mechanical stress and thus hold promise for high-power, flexible electronics.},

Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling grapheneâs properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial deformation4?8. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features7,8, no significant changes in grapheneâs band structure have been either observed or expected for realistic strains of up to 15\% (refs 9?11). Here we show that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields12?14 that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator15?20. We suggest realistic ways of creating this quantum state and observing the pseudomagnetic quantum Hall effect. We also show that strained superlattices can be used to open significant energy gaps in grapheneâs electronic spectrum.},

Using a combination of phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire polydomain thin-film models and epitaxial thin-film growth and characterization, the extrinsic or domain wall contribution to the low-field, reversible dielectric response is evaluated as a function of increasing domain wall density. Using epitaxial thin-film strain we have engineered a set of samples that possess a known quantity of 90Â° domain walls that act as a model system with which to probe the contribution from these ferroelastic domain walls. We observe a strong enhancement of the permittivity with increasing domain wall density that matches the predictions of the phenomenological models. Additionally, we report experimentally measured bounds to domain wall stiffness in such PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films as a function of domain wall density and frequency.},

 abstract = {Problems associated with large-scale pattern growth of graphene constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.},

The high capacitance of the ion gel, which originated from the formation of an electric double layer under the application of a gate voltage, yielded a high on-current and low voltage operation below 3 V. The graphene FETs fabricated on the plastic substrates showed a hole and electron mobility of 203 +/- 57 and 91 +/- 50 cm(2)/(V x s), respectively, at a drain bias of -1 V. Moreover, ion gel gated graphene FETs on the plastic substrates exhibited remarkably good mechanical flexibility. This method represents a significant step in the application of graphene to flexible and stretchable electronics.},

We demonstrate several appealing properties of graphene for this purpose, including its ability to spontaneously conform to significant surface topography, in a manner that yields effective contacts even to deep, recessed device regions. Mechanics modeling reveals the fundamental aspects of this process, as well as the use of the same layers of graphene for interconnects designed to accommodate strains of 100\% or more, in a completely reversible fashion. These attributes are compatible with conventional thin film processing and can yield high-performance devices in transparent layouts. Graphene interconnects possess attractive features for both existing and emerging applications of LEDs in information display, biomedical systems, and other environments.},

 abstract = {The understanding of crack formation due to applied stress is key to predicting the ultimate mechanical behavior of many solids. Here we present experimental and theoretical studies on cracks or tears in suspended monolayer graphene membranes. Using transmission electron microscopy, we investigate the crystallographic orientations of tears. Edges from mechanically induced ripping exhibit straight lines and are predominantly aligned in the armchair or zigzag directions of the graphene lattice. Electron-beam induced propagation of tears is also observed. Theoretical simulations account for the observed preferred tear directions, attributing the observed effect to an unusual nonmonotonic dependence of graphene edge energy on edge orientation with respect to the lattice. Furthermore, we study the behavior of tears in the vicinity of graphene grain boundaries, where tears surprisingly do not follow but cross grain boundaries. Our study provides significant insights into breakdown mechanisms of graphene in the presence of defective structures such as cracks and grain boundaries.},

@article{Lafkioti2010,
 abstract = {The intrinsic doping level of graphene prepared by mechanical exfoliation and standard lithography procedures on thermally oxidized silicon varies significantly and seems to depend strongly on processing details and the substrate morphology. Moreover, transport properties of such graphene devices suffer from hysteretic behavior under ambient conditions. The hysteresis presumably originates from dipolar adsorbates on the substrate or graphene surface. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to reliably obtain low intrinsic doping levels and to strongly suppress hysteretic behavior even in ambient air by depositing graphene on top of a thin, hydrophobic self-assembled layer of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The HMDS serves as a reproducible template that prevents the adsorption of dipolar substances. It may also screen the influence of substrate deficiencies.},

 abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m(-1)) and -690 Nm(-1), respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m(-1) and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sigma(int) = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

However, the difficulty in developing semiconducting materials with high stretchability required for such applications has restricted the range of applications of stretchable electronics. Here, we present stretchable, printable, and transparent transistors composed of monolithically patterned graphene films. This material offers excellent mechanical, electrical, and optical properties, capable of use as semiconducting channels as well as the source/drain electrodes. Such monolithic graphene transistors show hole and electron mobilities of 1188 Â± 136 and 422 Â± 52 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, with stable operation at stretching up to 5\% even after 1000 or more cycles.},

 abstract = {A periodically modulated graphene (PMG) generated by nanopatterned surfaces is reported to profoundly modify the intrinsic electronic properties of graphene. The temperature dependence of the sheet resistivity and gate response measurements clearly show a semiconductor-like behavior. Raman spectroscopy reveals significant shifts of the G and the 2D modes induced by the interaction with the underlying grid-like nanostructure. The influence of the periodic, alternating contact with the substrate surface was studied in terms of strain caused by bending of graphene and doping through chemical interactions with underlying substrate atoms. Electronic structure calculations performed on a model of PMG reveals that it is possible to tune a band gap within 0.14-0.19 eV by considering both the periodic mechanical bending and the surface coordination chemistry. Therefore, the PMG can be regarded as a further step toward band gap engineering of graphene devices.},

 abstract = {The fundamental properties of graphene are making it an attractive material for a wide variety of applications. Various techniques have been developed to produce graphene and recently we discovered the synthesis of large area graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane on Cu foils. We also showed that graphene growth on Cu is a surface-mediated process and the films were polycrystalline with domains having an area of tens of square micrometers. In this paper, we report on the effect of growth parameters such as temperature, and methane flow rate and partial pressure on the growth rate, domain size, and surface coverage of graphene as determined by Raman spectroscopy, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. On the basis of the results, we developed a two-step CVD process to synthesize graphene films with domains having an area of hundreds of square micrometers. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy clearly show an increase in domain size by changing the growth parameters. Transmission electron microscopy further shows that the domains are crystallographically rotated with respect to each other with a range of angles from about 13 to nearly 30? Electrical transport measurements performed on back-gated FETs show that overall films with larger domains tend to have higher carrier mobility up to about 16,000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we describe a graphene p-n junction created by chemical doping. We find that chemical doping does not reduce mobility in contrast to top-gating. The preparation technique has been developed from systematic studies about influences on the initial doping of freshly prepared graphene. We investigated the removal of adsorbates by vacuum treatment, annealing, and compensation doping using NH(3). Hysteretic behavior is observed in the electric field effect due to dipolar adsorbates like water and NH(3). Finally we demonstrate spatially selective doping of graphene using patterned PMMA. Four-terminal transport measurements of the p-n devices reveal edge channel mixing in the quantum hall regime. Quantized resistances of h/e(2), h/3e(2) and h/15e(2) can be observed as expected from theory.},

For example, recent measurements of epitaxial graphene on SiC show resistance arising from steps on the substrate. Here we calculate the deformation of graphene at substrate steps, and the resulting electrical resistance, over a wide range of step heights. The elastic deformations contribute only a very small resistance at the step. However, for graphene on SiC(0001) there is strong substrate-induced doping, and this is substantially reduced on the lower side of the step where graphene pulls away from the substrate. The resulting resistance explains the experimental measurements.},

 abstract = {The novel electronic properties of graphene, including a linear energy dispersion relation and purely two-dimensional structure, have led to intense research into possible applications of this material in nanoscale devices. Here we report the first observation of saturating transistor characteristics in a graphene field-effect transistor. The saturation velocity depends on the charge-carrier concentration and we attribute this to scattering by interfacial phonons in the SiO2 layer supporting the graphene channels. Unusual features in the current-voltage characteristic are explained by a field-effect model and diffusive carrier transport in the presence of a singular point in the density of states. The electrostatic modulation of the channel through an efficiently coupled top gate yields transconductances as high as 150 microS microm-1 despite low on-off current ratios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of two-dimensional graphene devices for analogue and radio-frequency circuit applications without the need for bandgap engineering.},

 abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

@article{Novoselov2007,
 abstract = {The quantum Hall effect (QHE), one example of a quantum phenomenon that occurs on a truly macroscopic scale, has attracted intense interest since its discovery in 1980 and has helped elucidate many important aspects of quantum physics. It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.},

@article{Petrone2012,
 abstract = {While chemical vapor deposition (CVD) promises a scalable method to produce large-area graphene, CVD-grown graphene has heretofore exhibited inferior electronic properties in comparison with exfoliated samples. Here we test the electrical transport properties of CVD-grown graphene in which two important sources of disorder, namely grain boundaries and processing-induced contamination, are substantially reduced. We grow CVD graphene with grain sizes up to 250 $\mu$m to abate grain boundaries, and we transfer graphene utilizing a novel, dry-transfer method to minimize chemical contamination. We fabricate devices on both silicon dioxide and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dielectrics to probe the effects of substrate-induced disorder. On both substrate types, the large-grain CVD graphene samples are comparable in quality to the best reported exfoliated samples, as determined by low-temperature electrical transport and magnetotransport measurements. Small-grain samples exhibit much greater variation in quality and inferior performance by multiple measures, even in samples exhibiting high field-effect mobility. These results confirm the possibility of achieving high-performance graphene devices based on a scalable synthesis process.},

@article{Schedin2007,
 abstract = {The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity. The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects, which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.},

 abstract = {Graphene is a truly two-dimensional atomic crystal with exceptional electronic and mechanical properties. Whereas conventional bulk and thin-film materials have been studied extensively, the key mechanical properties of graphene, such as tearing and cracking, remain unknown, partly due to its two-dimensional nature and ultimate single-atom-layer thickness, which result in the breakdown of conventional material models. By combining first-principles ReaxFF molecular dynamics and experimental studies, a bottom-up investigation of the tearing of graphene sheets from adhesive substrates is reported, including the discovery of the formation of tapered graphene nanoribbons. Through a careful analysis of the underlying molecular rupture mechanisms, it is shown that the resulting nanoribbon geometry is controlled by both the graphene-substrate adhesion energy and by the number of torn graphene layers. By considering graphene as a model material for a broader class of two-dimensional atomic crystals, these results provide fundamental insights into the tearing and cracking mechanisms of highly confined nanomaterials.},

 abstract = {Photo-oxidation of spin-cast films of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene has been exploited to develop a novel means of spatially modulating doping in graphene. The degree of n-doping of initially p-type graphene can be varied by laser irradiation time or intensity with carrier density change up to â¼7 Ã 10(12) cm(-2). This n-doping approach is demonstrated as an effective means of creating p-n junctions in graphene. The ability to direct-write arbitrary shapes and patterns of n-doped regions in graphene simply by scanning a laser source should facilitate the exploitation of p-n junctions for a variety of electronic and optoelectronic device applications.},

 abstract = {In this study, we report a buckling approach for graphene and graphene ribbons on stretchable elastomeric substrates. Stretched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with different prestrains were used to receive the transferred graphene, and nanoscale periodical buckling of graphene was spontaneously formed after strain release. The morphology and periodicity of the as-formed graphene ripples are dependent strongly on their original shapes and substrates' prestrains. Regular periodicity of the ripples preferred to form for narrow graphene ribbons, and both the amplitude and periodicity are reduced with the increase of prestrain on PDMS. The graphene ripples have the ability to afford large strain deformation, thus making it ideal for flexible electronic applications. It was demonstrated that both graphene ribbon and nanographene film ripples could be used for strain sensors, and their resistance changes upon different strains were studied. This simple and controllable process of buckled graphene provides a feasible fabrication for graphene flexible electronic devices and strain sensors due to its novel mechanical and electrical properties.},

Perfect suspended graphene is rather insensitive to H2O adsorbates, as doping requires highly oriented H2O clusters. For graphene on a defective SiO2 substrate, we find a strongly different behavior: H2O adsorbates can shift the substrateâs impurity bands and change their hybridization with the graphene bands. In this way, H2O can lead to doping of graphene for much lower adsorbate concentrations than for free hanged graphene. The effect depends strongly on the microscopic substrate properties.},

@article{Xie2011,
 abstract = {The transfer of electrons between a solid surface and adsorbed atomic or molecular species is fundamental in natural and synthetic processes, being at the heart of most catalytic reactions and many sensors. In special cases, metallic conduction can be induced at the surface of, for example, Si-terminated SiC1, or mixed-terminated ZnO2, in the presence of a hydrogen adlayer. Generally, only the surface atoms are significantly affected by adsorbates. However, remotely changing electronic states far from the adsorbed layer is possible if these states are electrostatically coupled to the surface. Here we show that the surface adsorption of common solvents such as acetone, ethanol, and water can induce a large change (factor of three) in the conductivity at the buried interface between SrTiO3 substrates and LaAlO3 thin films3-8. This phenomenon is observed only for polar solvents. Our result provides experimental evidence that adsorbates at the LaAlO3 surface induce accumulation of electrons at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, suggesting a general polarization-facilitated electronic transfer mechanism, which can be used for sensor applications.},

@article{Xue2011,
 abstract = {Graphene has demonstrated great promise for future electronics technology as well as fundamental physics applications because of its linear energy-momentum dispersion relations which cross at the Dirac point. However, accessing the physics of the low-density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because of disorder that leaves the graphene with local microscopic electron and hole puddles. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult. Recently, it has been shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved device performance. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moir\'{e} patterns. However, contrary to predictions, this conformation does not lead to a sizeable band gap because of the misalignment of the lattices. Moreover, local spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the electron-hole charge fluctuations are reduced by two orders of magnitude as compared with those on silicon oxide. This leads to charge fluctuations that are as small as in suspended graphene, opening up Dirac point physics to more diverse experiments.},

@article{Yamamoto2012,
 abstract = {Thin membranes exhibit complex responses to external forces or geometrical constraints. A familiar example is the wrinkling instability, exhibited by human skin, plant leaves, and fabrics, resulting from the relative ease of bending versus stretching. Here, we study the wrinkling of graphene, the thinnest and stiffest known membrane, deposited on a silica substrate decorated with silica nanoparticles. At small nanoparticle density monolayer graphene adheres to the substrate, elastically stretching to form a detachment zone around each nanoparticle. With increasing particle density, elastic stretching energy is reduced by the formation of wrinkles which connect particles. Above a critical nanoparticle density, the wrinkles form a percolating network through the sample. As the graphene membrane is made thicker, delamination from the substrate is observed. Results can be well understood within a continuum elastic model and have important implications for strain engineering the electronic properties of graphene.},

@article{Yan2012,
 abstract = {Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties attract particular interest owing to the chiral character of the charge carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect observable even at room temperature1?3. Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling grapheneâs properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial deformation4?8. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features7,8, no significant changes in grapheneâs band structure have been either observed or expected for realistic strains of up to 15\% (refs 9?11). Here we show that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields12?14 that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator15?20. We suggest realistic ways of creating this quantum state and observing the pseudomagnetic quantum Hall effect. We also show that strained superlattices can be used to open significant energy gaps in grapheneâs electronic spectrum.},

@article{Zang2013,
 abstract = {Crumpled graphene films are widely used, for instance in electronics, energy storage, composites and biomedicine. Although it is known that the degree of crumpling affects graphene's properties and the performance of graphene-based devices and materials, the controlled folding and unfolding of crumpled graphene films has not been demonstrated. Here we report an approach to reversibly control the crumpling and unfolding of large-area graphene sheets. We show with experiments, atomistic simulations and theory that, by harnessing the mechanical instabilities of graphene adhered on a biaxially pre-stretched polymer substrate and by controlling the relaxation of the pre-strains in a particular order, graphene films can be crumpled into tailored self-organized hierarchical structures that mimic superhydrophobic leaves. The approach enables us to fabricate large-area conductive coatings and electrodes showing superhydrophobicity, high transparency, and tunable wettability and transmittance. We also demonstrate that crumpled graphene-polymer laminates can be used as artificial-muscle actuators.},

@article{Zhang2005,
 abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},
